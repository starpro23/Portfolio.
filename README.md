Hi, I’m Stanely Mbogo!

I’m a passionate software engineering student, currently sharpening my skills in Python and C. Whether I’m coding up a storm, smashing birdies on the badminton court, or glued to the latest MotoGP race, I thrive on learning and adventure.

Curiosity is my secret weapon—I love exploring uncharted project ideas, collaborating with diverse teams, and picking up inspiration from everywhere (yes, I’m a little nosy—but in the best way possible!).

When I’m not chasing bugs or bikes, you’ll find me sharing tech tips, discoveries, and creative hacks online. Let’s connect and build something amazing together!
